42,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Slight compromise in the OnePlus experience,4,"I have used the OnePlus 3t earlier and was blown away by the experience. The features, the customisation ability, and everything was top notch. In fact OnePlus had the dark theme way before Android offically launched it for the Google pixel.Had this been some other xyz brand, I'd have been blown away, but since this is a OnePlus, I expected a lot more. Regarding hardware, it's only the battery that I feel needs improvement.But the software was a huge step down. I mean since when did removing features started being called an upgrade? Some very cool features like the car locator widget in the OnePlus shelf, displaying time with seconds in the status bar, have been removed. The shelf has moved to the top right corner, the Google news feed on the left side of home screen cannot be disabled, and the camera doesn't support full screen video recording. Moreover, one of the most significant feature introduced in Android 10, the free form popup window has been removed as well. The Oxygen OS 12 update is more of a downgrade than an upgrade."

45,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",After sales is pathetic,3,"I recently bought a Oneplus Nord 2T. Unfortunately, it slid out of my hands one day, and to my astonishment, the screen broke. I applied for replacement after quickly looking out the approved service facility because this breakage is not covered by the guarantee. Even 15 days later, the service centre claims they still don't have the spare. I'm really frustrated that a well-known company like Oneplus can't provide spare parts quickly."

Charging is also super fast with charging time being a maximum of 30 mins to go from 0 to 100%.But it really needs improvement in the battery backup sector as the battery barely lasts 1 day and sometimes you might need to charge the phone twice in a day.

 I have used this phone for 1 month. Now I am reviewing it. It have a very nice processor. And it can be best for gaming and other hard works like video rendering. It can compete even iPhone 11.Even It supports 5G while iPhone 11 doesn't which cost almost 1.5 to 2 times. I have compared their cameras also both are almost equal. But it have smaller battery capacity than any other phone in this price range. But I have a great display which gives you a wonderful mixture of colours and have refresh rate of 90hz.

The biggest cons are it gets heated and the battery gets drained quickly although the fast charging makes up for it. Camera, Unlock feature, Alert slider, Lifestyle modes, etc. are all good enough but the phone is little pricey compared to others in this range for its specifications. There seems to be a software bug in the closing all apps feature which sometimes won't kill the current app. I hope with software updates the heating, battery drain, etc issues get resolved.Will update review on usage.##Update after 2 months usage##The phone is really good. I had not used the camera much earlier but it clicks really nice photos. Battery charging is awesome. And the close all apps bug, heating issues have been resolved after software update. Not tested the phone for gaming much but it does get heated then."

Looks and feels premiums.Processor can easily handle multitasking and frequent app shiftingMinimum bloatware.Sound quality is great.Haptic feedback is also good.Cons:It's UI feels more like Realme than OnePlus, which is a big let down for me.

130,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",A THING OF BEAUTY!!!,5,"If you're looking for a phone under 30k primarily for content consumption then one plus Nord 2t is definitely one of the best options in its segment.DISPLAY - Absolutely in love with the smooth 90hz amoled display, colours are bright and vivid. The display coupled with its kick-ass set of speakers makes it a delight to watch high quality content on OTT platforms and YouTube.BATTERY & CHARGING - Comes with a 80w fast charger that charges the battery to 100% in less than 30 minutes and lasts a full day even with heavy usage.When in hurry, simply charge it for 10 minutes and you're good to go for the next 4-5 hours.GAMING -  I am not much of a gamer but from what i have seen, it handles gaming pretty well without any issues.HEATING - I was quite sceptical before buying Nord 2T given the notorious performance of its predecessor in this particular department. But looks like they have improved as I have not faced any major heating issues till now despite long sessions of heavy usage.CAMERA - The back camera is fantastic and performs pretty well in all kinds of lighting conditions. Pictures are well balanced with the right dose of saturation and contrast. Camera has night mode and ultra wide features as well.Now coming to the front camera, its a  HUGE LET DOWN. Perhaps the only thing in this phone that has disappointed me is Its front camera. I found the front camera performance to be very inconsistent and borderline terrible at times specially in indoor conditions. Don't buy this one if you take too many selfies.USER INTERFACE - Clean and crisp, without any bloatwares.We may not get ""the Classic Oxygen OS"" anymore but it's still oxygen OS and IMO it is far better than the UI experience provided by any of it's competitors.BUILD & DESIGN - The Nord 2T looks classy  and feels premium to the core. No arguments on this one.Overall, i am completely happy and satisfied with this phone's performance till now and I find it to be value for money at 29k!!!I believe every phone compromises somewhere or the other in this price range, just be sure about your requirements and make a decision accordingly."

However there are still some bugs, the photos can be better, lacks pure Android experience for which OnePlus was known.Old review: ""Almost nothing is good about this phone. O2 operating system is now CO2 Operating system. Automatic brightness is a feature from decades earlier yet you've still managed to mess this up. Again battery optimisation is the worst, Around 4 hours screen time. Camera is always over saturated and iso is always on the higher side. Background apps get closed so fast so multitasking is a no no, it straggles to keep up. System hang issue faced even in Android 12. Dimensity 1200 is better than Dimensity 1300, it's deceiving. Why did we pay around 29k for this phone? I mean 4k 60fps is now 4k 30fps? Really? One last recommendation, WORK ON THE SOFTWARE. This is not a stable software."""

256,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Battery performance,3,Most perimeters of One Plus Nord are satisfactory except the performance of the battery. The power drains off very fast after charge of 100%. Even after opting for battery power saver it doesn't give the desired results. The company needs to address this problem at the earliest through some software updates. This review is after 24 hours of personal usage.

259,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Real Flagship Killer Phone,5,"Bought this as a replacement to a Samsung Smartphone. Its very clear that Samsung A53/A52 has OnepPlus Nord in its cross hairs as both try to outdo each other on price and feature. But the real deal is this, on a price to performance basis I don't think Samsung can match OnePlus without cannibalizing its sales of phones which are selling at 50,000 Rs plus range, hence you see things like Samsung capping the Ram and Storage ( i.e deliberately cripple the phone to protect the premium phones). What I found with OnePlus is they go all out on each price point - i.e deliver the maximum which is possible at a particular price point without thinking about cannibalizing its premium range of phone. Also, my last phone which was hardly 3 years phone ( Samsung Galaxy Note 10) died due to water damage - this was supposed to be a IP68 phone, after this incident I don't think paying a premium for Samsung which unlike Apple does not last more than 3 years. If I were to spend 50k plus on a phone I would rather buy an Apple which reliability wise is like the Toyota of the phone world ( my wife's Iphone 6s has lasted 8 years !!). So for the forseeable future I see myself sticking to OnePlus with an intention to replace the phone every 3-4 years."

Charging is super fast. 0-100 in approximately 30 mins but I don't see how that compensates for a bad battery backup. Splendid phone otherwise. Camera is top notch so is the performance.

275,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",A Solid package in this Price segment - some practical points -,5,"Things to consider if u r looking for it1. 90hz is very smooth in this phone - except Youtube - in every app you will see highr refresh rate UNLIKE iqoo (considering it the only competitor) where you will not see higher refresh rate anywhere except homescreen .2. heating issue - due to glass back every machine heats up - i have ip 11 and comparing to that this heats like NOTHING - so no heating ISSUES per se3. I think proximity sensor is not accurate but only sometimes , and also it feels like sometimes sound from earpiece is a little less4. games work like charm - although it is not for gamers - but it does a great job if you play for 2-3 hours daily5. Front camera feels like 2 MP when taking the shot - but in actuality a very capable camera sensor is provided - if you use Gcam just for front - you will see that the selfies are literally like PIXEL 6 Pro ( I know this is a big claim ) and back main sensor is LEGIT OP !6. Haptic feedback in my phone is really charming - very good - you will surely feel like holding a really premium phone for sure7. Ofcourse one of my main reason to buy this phone was good OS and built quality and despite bad OxygenOS reputation - It in reality is way too good than its competitors still.Be wise with your purchase DONT go blindly by the specs . thanks ."

284,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)",Android Auto doesn't work - See edit below for the Fix,2,"Android Auto is such a feature that all of us use almost on a daily basis. I have been using Oneplus 6T for last 4 years, and the feature works so seamlessly in my compatible car. But this new phone (Nord 2T) which is running a latest version of Android 12, doesn't work.  And that's a big turn off for me and I have initiated a return today - hope I get a replacement as the technician appointment is fixed 7 days from now.But if anyone is looking for a smooth device, please don't buy this phone.  In today's times, it is definitely not accepted if a basic feature like Android Auto doesn't work.[EDITED on 15 Oct 2022]: Raised a replacement request - it's not automatic. They called me to say that they will fix an appointment with Oneplus technician after a week (19th) however, the someone from their Bangalore center called up on 13th. Asked me the usual things - like is the software updated, etc. Suggested a reset which I had done the previous night itself. So he asked me to take it to the nearest authorized service center. Took it to Gurgaon service center, demonstrated the problem. They even connected another same model phone from their inventory - didn't work. Conencted a Oneplus 9 and it worked without issues. Took all the debug logs and told me that the they will share with the Bangalore team for fix.In the meantime, one of my friend suggested to change cables. I had already tried with 3 Oneplus cables and one Xiaomi cable - they didn't work. But this time, I tried with a simple cable that I had bought in the local market for some other device. When I connected this cable, bang... it worked! So, in a way, my problem is solved but Oneplus and Google AA team will have to work together to give the customers a seamless way for their products to work.[Edited on 24 Oct ]: Even with the 3rd party cable, it stopped working. :("

Need a standard size phone viz is single handed and robust.4. one who's lot more defined towards brand value.This phone performs way better than all the reviewers told in their videos. Trust me guys I've seen no heating issues, no lag, 90Hz performs very well and no big deal of getting 120Hz. This panel works well.Charging Experience is very good.Phone feels sturdy and premium.I was earlier going for Nothing and was confused between Nord 2t IQOO Neo 6 and this phone yet I chose this considering a balanced package at this price point.One plus never let you down. It is just that technology is getting saturated and people are like checking the antutu scores just for the gaming but if you're a casual user and need optimal software experience with ZERO bloatware this this is the perfect choice in this segment. Go for it......No regrets at all and don't look at the negative comments in the reviews. Plus that alert slider is also a premium feature."

The phone is working smoothly. I am not a gamer and don't play any games but I use multiple apps. I find the phone to be handling very smoothly. I heating issue is solved with the latest update.Some pros and cons are as under ( comparing this phone with my previous phone OnePlus 6T)Pros- Great build quality feels premium, Great speakers, 6+ hrs battery back up, OnePlus user experience, extended 1 yr warranty at only additional Rs 700, Quick charging, smooth experience.Cons- Average Camera, Phone receiver speaker was initially not clear, however I have find it to improve.If you are shifting from any flagship phone to this you will find the device to be very average however this is a best option to upgrade from budget smartphone/first smartphone.Lastly it cannot be compared with nothing phone. It comes in very different price segment. Nothing phone with charger will cost you around 40k, so pointless to compare my view.It's a very safe phone to purchase no compromise however no surprises also. Go for it. My rating 4.2/5."

Don't purchase any mobile from Amazon."

 I went to Goa for vacation.  There we were going in a boat Suddenly the phone felt hot in my pocket and when I took it out, smoke was coming out.Then the people standing around me immediately poured water on him, thinking that no one would be harmed.  Even so, the smoke did not stop.After that I discussed the matter in the service center of OnePlus company and deposited the phone.  After 3 days I got a call from one plus company that we have checked the phone with our technician and your phone is burnt due to splashing in water so company can not claim your phone under warranty.I am saddened by this response from One Plus company.  This is said to be very embarrassing.I am writing this review so that this does not happen to anyone else.I am warning for your safety. Don't buy phone from OnePlus company.Pls See the Attached Video."

Battery drains quickly if you game or use heavy apps.2. Processor could have been snapdragon 778g.3. Apps optimization and image processing could be better for dimensity 1300.4. Not a highly customisable ui.So if you are not a gamer consider rest everything you need is on pro side. 😁Is there any other phone that can beat this one?Yes. Samsung galaxy A52s or A53.Check online and offline, if you get it in 26-28k  i would say go for it. Otherwise this phone is the best value for money for smart buyers. 👍"

 It was an notable upgrade from my old Samsung galaxy j6. Camera is awesome in this range and dimension 1300 processor is upto the mark. I was a little apprehensive at first about OnePlus bcoz it's been acquired by oppo and that I was to going to get an oppo under OnePlus branding. But now after 1 month of use I am satisfied. There is a little issue with wifi connectivity but it can be fixed with software upgrades. Also 128 gb storage is more than enough and 8 gigs of ram makes it fast for an avid user.
